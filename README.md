In order to run this code, please run any commands you would like following the template detailed after like 39. The class object is called inmemoryDB as was given in the example. Please use the syntax .XYZ() in order to run any commands you wish. When trying to "put" when a transaction in progress the python script will throw an exception ending execution. Thus, if you have any lines after the exception they will not run. If you want the rest to run please comment out the .put before a transaction is run using "#". 


IF YOU WANT TO RUN THE EXAMPLE GRADING SCHEME GIVEN IN THE INSTRUCTIONS JUST RUN THE SCRIPT. THE EXAMPLE IS HARDCODED. 



I think this was a well written assignment. I would maybe add some history explaining how this parallels a real databse with actual examples / code from a real databse such as mongoDB. In addition, I think if the graders used an auto grading system that would probably work better than the current system. I would also like if the instructions told us how we are getting graded, i.e. which testing bank will be used.
